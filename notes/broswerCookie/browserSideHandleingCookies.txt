when you visit a website, the browser automatically handles the storage and retrieval of cookies associated with that particular website.

Here's a brief overview of how the process works:

Requesting a webpage: When you enter a website's URL or click on a link, your browser sends a request to the website's server.

Server response with cookies: The website's server processes the request and may include a "Set-Cookie" header in the response. 
This header contains information about the cookie, such as its name, value, expiration, and other optional attributes.

Storing the cookie: Upon receiving the "Set-Cookie" header, the browser stores the cookie data locally on your computer. 
The exact storage location depends on the browser and its configuration. Typically, the cookies are stored in files on your hard drive or in memory.

Sending cookies with subsequent requests: When you navigate to other pages within the same website or make subsequent requests to the server,
 the browser automatically includes the relevant cookies in the "Cookie" header of the request. This allows the server to identify and associate 
 the request with the appropriate session or user information stored in the cookies.

Server processing with cookie data: The website's server receives the request along with the cookie data and can use the information stored in the cookies 
to personalize the response, authenticate the user, track user behavior, or perform other necessary tasks.

In this way, the browser acts as the intermediary between the website and the cookies. It manages the storage, retrieval, and sending of cookies 
based on the server's instructions.

It's important to note that browsers have built-in security measures to protect user privacy. Cookies are subject to certain restrictions and policies 
defined by the browser, such as the same-origin policy and restrictions on third-party cookies, to prevent unauthorized access or tracking. Additionally, 
users can configure their browser settings to manage or block cookies according to their preferences.
