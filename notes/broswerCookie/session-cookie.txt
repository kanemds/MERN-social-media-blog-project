Let's say you visit an online shopping website. When you first land on the website, it assigns you a unique session ID and stores it in a cookie.
 This session ID is used to maintain your shopping session while you browse and interact with the website.

Here's how it works:

You open your browser and navigate to the online shopping website.
The website's server generates a session ID for you and sends a "Set-Cookie" header to your browser, instructing it to store the session ID in a cookie.

Your browser stores the cookie in memory or temporary storage, specifically tied to the current browser session.

As you browse the website, any subsequent requests to the server include the session cookie in the "Cookie" header, allowing the server to recognize your session and provide personalized information.

If you close the browser window or end your browsing session, the session cookie is deleted automatically. The next time you visit the website, 
a new session ID will be generated, and a new session cookie will be created.

The purpose of a session cookie is to maintain session-specific information temporarily. 
It allows the website to remember your preferences and keep track of your activities during a single browsing session. Once you close the browser window, 
the session cookie is discarded, and the website will not be able to recognize your previous session when you return.
