Client-Server Architecture is a design pattern used in distributed systems.

  It involves two separate entities: the client and the server.
  The client is responsible for the user interface and user interactions.
  The server is responsible for processing requests, handling data storage, and executing business logic.
  Communication between the client and server happens over a network.
  It follows a request-response model, where the client sends a request, and the server responds with data or results.
  In many cases, the server is stateless, not retaining client information between requests.
  The architecture allows for scalability, reliability, and interoperability.
  Clients and servers can use different technologies as long as they communicate through standardized protocols.
  In web applications, the client is often a web browser or a mobile app, and the server is the backend infrastructure that hosts and processes the application.
