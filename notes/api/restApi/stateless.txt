In RESTful APIs, "statelessness" means the server doesn't retain any information about the client's state between requests.

Each client request is treated as an independent and complete transaction.
The server doesn't remember the client's past interactions, preferences, or session history.
There is no server-side session storage; relevant information is passed in request headers or parameters.
Statelessness simplifies the server's architecture, making it easier to scale.
Each client request is standalone and self-contained; the server doesn't rely on previous requests to handle subsequent ones.
Clients must include all necessary data and authentication details in each request.
Security measures like authentication tokens or API keys are used to ensure authorized access to resources.

Tokens in stateless RESTful APIs play a crucial role in security, authentication, and authorization.
Two common types of tokens used are Authentication Tokens and Access Tokens.

Authentication Tokens: user login, identify current login user and send back user's data from database

  Used to authenticate the client's identity when accessing protected resources.
  Clients include the authentication token in request headers for verification by the server.
  Common authentication tokens include JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and OAuth tokens.
  JWT is a compact, self-contained token format with user-related information and a digital signature for authenticity.




Access Tokens: provide the limit access base on the current login user's role such as: admin, employee, user.

  Specific to OAuth, they authorize client access to protected resources after user authorization.
  Clients request tokens during authentication and use them in subsequent requests until they expire or get revoked.
  Tokens eliminate the need to send sensitive credentials like usernames and passwords with each request, enhancing security.
  Token-based authentication allows clients to work with multiple servers in a distributed system without sharing sessions or user-specific data, promoting scalability and security.
  Proper implementation and security measures are essential to prevent unauthorized access and vulnerabilities.


Developers must handle token expiration and refreshing appropriately for a smooth and secure user experience.
