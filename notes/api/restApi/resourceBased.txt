Resource-Based is a fundamental principle of the REST architectural style.
Everything in a RESTful API is treated as a resource.
Each resource is uniquely identified by a URL (Uniform Resource Locator).
Resources can be data objects, images, videos, user profiles, services, etc.
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are performed on resources using standard HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE).
Clients interact with the API by sending requests to specific URLs representing resources.
The URL itself carries all the information needed to identify the resource and the action to be performed.
RESTful APIs are resource-oriented, centered around exposing resources and their URLs.
Resource hierarchy can be established by organizing resources in parent-child relationships using URLs.
The Resource-Based principle promotes a clear separation of concerns and scalability in API design and implementation.
