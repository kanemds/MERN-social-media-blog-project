__dirname:

It is a global variable available in Node.js.
It contains the full path of the directory in which the current module file is located.
The value of __dirname is determined at runtime and is not affected by where the script is called from.
It can be used to construct file paths or reference files relative to the current module's directory.
The path provided by __dirname is always an absolute path, not a relative path.

example if run console.log(__dirname) in server.js

absolute path:
  /home/kanem/lighthouse/ownProject/projects/react/mern techNotes/server

path.join(__dirname, '/public')

absolute + '/public':

  /home/kanem/lighthouse/ownProject/projects/react/mern techNotes/server/public

path.join:
  create file or directory paths in a cross-platform (window, mac, etc)

  it is used to concatenate the directory and filename variables to create the filePath:
    const directory = 'myDirectory';
    const filename = 'myFile.txt';

    const filePath = path.join(directory, filename);

Windows output: myDirectory\myFile.txt

Unix-like systems output: myDirectory/myFile.txt

path.join helps ensure that file paths are correctly constructed regardless of the operating system,
making your code more portable and resilient to platform differences.
