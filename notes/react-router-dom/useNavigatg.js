useNavigate('/login', { replace: true }) from home to login  replace the current route from home to login[root, login]

useNavigate(-1) from login will go back to root,

  useNavigate('/login') from home to login[root, home].push(login) === [root, home, login]

useNavigate(-1) from login will go back to home,

  In React, the choice between useNavigate(-1) and useNavigate('/', { replace: true }) depends on your specific use case and what you want to achieve with navigation.

    useNavigate(-1):

This hook is typically used for navigating back in the browser history.
When you call useNavigate(-1), it is equivalent to pressing the back button in the browser.
It will take you one step back in the history stack.


  import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'

function MyComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate()

  const handleGoBack = () => {
    navigate(-1)
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleGoBack}>Go Back</button>
  )
}
useNavigate('/', { replace: true }):
This hook is used for navigating to a specific route while replacing the current entry in the browser history.
It replaces the current history entry with the new one, so when the user clicks the back button, they won't go back to the previous route; instead, they will exit the application or go to the root route.


import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'

function MyComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate()

  const handleGoToHome = () => {
    navigate('/', { replace: true })
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleGoToHome}>Go to Home (replace)</button>
  )
}

So, choose between these options based on whether you want to navigate back in history or replace the current history entry with a new one, depending on your application's requirements.

The choice between these two options depends on your application's design and the expected user flow after logging out:

If you want to allow users to navigate back through the pages they were on before logging out and potentially revisit those pages, useNavigate(-1) is a better choice.

If you want to provide a more controlled and secure logout experience, where users can't easily return to their previous pages after logging out, useNavigate(' / ', { replace: true }) may be the better option.
