 The data retrieval and storage operations are performed synchronously, meaning that the JavaScript execution waits for the operation to complete before proceeding to the next line of code.

localStorage:

Data persists even after the browser is closed and is available across sessions.
Shared across all tabs/windows from the same origin.
No expiration time; data remains stored until explicitly removed by the user or the application.

// Set data in localStorage
localStorage.setItem('username', 'JohnDoe');
localStorage.setItem('isLoggedIn', 'true');

// Retrieve data from localStorage
const username = localStorage.getItem('username');
const isLoggedIn = localStorage.getItem('isLoggedIn');

console.log(username); // Output: JohnDoe
console.log(isLoggedIn); // Output: true


sessionStorage:

Data is available only for the duration of the current browser session.
Limited to the specific tab/window where it was set.
Automatically cleared when the browser session ends  (when the browser is closed).


// Set data in sessionStorage
sessionStorage.setItem('language', 'en');
sessionStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');

// Retrieve data from sessionStorage
const language = sessionStorage.getItem('language');
const theme = sessionStorage.getItem('theme');

console.log(language); // Output: en
console.log(theme); // Output: dark
