The cookie will only be sent by the browser over HTTPS connections.
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) ensures encrypted communication between the client and the server.(provides protection against interception by a middleman or eavesdropper during the transit of data)
By enabling the secure flag for a cookie, the browser will only send that cookie over a secure HTTPS connection.
 HTTPS encrypts the communication between the client (browser) and the server, making it significantly more difficult for an attacker to intercept and access the transmitted data.
The data contained in the cookie is encrypted during transmission.
Encryption protects the cookie from interception and unauthorized access.
Setting secure: true mitigates man-in-the-middle attacks and unauthorized data interception.
It is a best practice to enable secure: true for sensitive cookies.
Sensitive cookies include those used for authentication or session management.
By using secure: true, the security of user credentials and session data is enhanced.


When a cookie is set with the secure: true flag, it means that the browser will only send the cookie over a secure HTTPS connection. 
This ensures that the cookie is transmitted encrypted between the client (browser) and the server, making it difficult for anyone to intercept and decode the cookie during transit.

Setting secure: true for a cookie ensures it is transmitted only over HTTPS connections, providing encryption during transmission.

Cookies are stored on the client's machine, but their content may be difficult for other websites or scripts to access.

However, sensitive data within a cookie, such as a JWT, can potentially be decoded by client-side JavaScript within the same domain.

To enhance security:

Implement strong server-side security measures to protect sensitive data and handle JWT verification securely.
Use encryption and signing mechanisms for JWTs to prevent tampering and unauthorized access.
Set an appropriate expiration time for JWTs and consider token revocation and refreshing.
Validate and verify the JWT on the server-side for each request to ensure integrity, authenticity, and proper authorization.
While cookies and JWTs can provide security, it's crucial to implement proper server-side security measures and follow best practices to ensure their safety and protect sensitive data.



The encryption provided by HTTPS ensures that the data being transmitted, including the cookie, is encrypted and can only be deciphered by the intended recipient, which is the server. This encryption prevents unauthorized parties from intercepting and reading the data, providing protection against middleman attacks where an attacker attempts to capture and extract sensitive information during transit.

By enforcing the secure flag and transmitting cookies over HTTPS, the risk of data interception and unauthorized access is significantly reduced, enhancing the overall security of the transmitted data.
