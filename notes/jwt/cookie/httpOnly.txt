Client-side JavaScript runs within a web browser environment.
It is executed directly by the web browser on the client's machine.
It enhances the user experience and interactivity of a website.
JavaScript code is delivered from the web server to the client's browser.
The browser interprets and executes the JavaScript code locally.
Client-side JavaScript operates on the client's machine, not the server.
It enables dynamic and interactive functionality on the website.
Examples of client-side JavaScript functionality include form validation, user interface interactions, AJAX requests, and DOM manipulation.
Client-side JavaScript is distinct from server-side programming languages like Node.js, Python, or PHP.
Server-side languages generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code sent to the client.
