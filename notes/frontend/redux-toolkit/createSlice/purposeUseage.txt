createSlice is a function from Redux Toolkit that helps in creating a slice of the global state in Redux.
It generates a reducer function and action creators for that specific slice of the state.
The generated reducer function handles state updates based on dispatched actions.
The global Redux store manages the overall state of the application, including the state managed by the created slice.
createSlice reduces boilerplate code by providing a concise syntax for defining reducers and action creators.
It enforces immutable updates to the state using the immer library, making state mutations easier to manage.
The created slice allows you to organize and encapsulate related actions and reducers in a modular and maintainable way.
The state managed by the created slice is accessible to other components throughout the application.
createSlice is not strictly for local state management; it is part of the global Redux state management.
Overall, createSlice simplifies the process of defining and managing a slice of the global state in Redux, making it more efficient and maintainable.
