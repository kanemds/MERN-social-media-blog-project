The default middleware provided by Redux Toolkit includes some basic functionalities but does not include all the functionalities mentioned in the apiSlice.middleware. Here's what the default middleware typically includes:

Thunk middleware: It enables handling of asynchronous actions in Redux using thunks, which are functions that can delay the dispatch of actions or perform side effects.

Redux DevTools Extension integration: It enables integration with Redux DevTools Extension, which provides advanced debugging and time-traveling capabilities for Redux state.

Immutable state verification: It checks for accidental mutations in the Redux state to enforce immutability.

Batching: It batches multiple dispatched actions into a single re-render cycle, which can improve performance in certain scenarios.

These functionalities help with common tasks in Redux development but do not specifically address API-related functionality like caching, automatic action creation, normalization, or cancellation.
For those API-specific functionalities, you need to include the apiSlice.middleware provided by the createApi function or other middleware designed for API handling.
