express.static:
a built-in middleware function in Express.js that is used to serve static files,
 such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets, from a specified directory. 
 It is a convenient way to make static files accessible to clients.

Here's an overview of express.static:

express.static takes a directory path as its first argument and returns a middleware function.
The middleware function can be used with app.use() or app.get() (or similar) methods to handle incoming requests for static files.
When a request is made for a static file, Express will check if the requested file exists in the specified directory.
If a matching file is found, it will be sent as a response to the client.
The static files can be accessed by clients using their URL path relative to the root URL of the application.
Express will automatically set the appropriate headers (such as Content-Type) based on the file's extension.
The express.static middleware handles all the necessary logic for serving static files, including caching and conditional requests.


example:

  - localhost:3000
  - app.use('/', express.static(path.join(__dirname, '/public')))

  localhost:3000/
